# Semantic-segmentation-and-Depth-estimation
Semantic segmentation and depth estimation with hardware restricted fully ConvNets (FCNs) for autnomous driving.

## General
This repository should do two things: 1) show that it is possible to do dense prediction tasks with limited hardware and get utilizable reults. 2) provide code examples that are kept easy to understand and meant to re-use for different projects involving FCN
